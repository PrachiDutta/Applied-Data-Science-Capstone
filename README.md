IBM Applied Data Science Capstone – SpaceX Launch Analysis

Overview: 
This project analyzes SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to explore factors affecting launch success and build a predictive model using machine learning.

Key Steps
Data Collection: Historical launches via SpaceX API

Data Wrangling: Cleaned data, created payload mass feature
EDA: Scatter plots and success distribution charts

Visual Analytics: Launch site locations plotted with matplotlib

Machine Learning: Logistic Regression model to predict launch success

Results:
- Payload mass and launch site are significant predictors
- Logistic Regression achieved reasonable accuracy
- Visualizations show distribution of successful vs failed launches
